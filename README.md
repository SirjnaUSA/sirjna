# Sirjna (MVP) â€” Frappe v15 App

This is a minimal, valid Frappe v15 app skeleton that installs on Frappe Cloud
and fixes the prior error:

> Not a valid Frappe App! Files hooks.py or patches.txt does not exist inside sirjna/sirjna directory.

It includes both `hooks.py` and `patches.txt` under `sirjna/sirjna/` and a tiny CSS + two www pages.
